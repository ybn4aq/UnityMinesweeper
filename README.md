Making a Minesweeper desktop app in Unity using C#

Hello! My name is Thomas and this is one of my first attempts at making a video game.
Minesweeper has always been one of my favorite games, but none of the ones out there are to my specification.
Specifically, the Windows one now features ads, and the Google one doesn't support the "sweeping" click, where you double
click a revealed tile that has a sufficient number of flags adjacent to it to automatically clear any remaining tiles around
it. Therefore, I aimed to make a Minesweeper desktop app that supported this, and was straight forward as a whole.

**TO RUN**:
1. Download just the "Executable" folder
2. Run Minesweeper.exe


**CONTROLS**:

Left Click: Dig a tile
Right Click / Shift + Left Click: Flag/Unflag a Tile
Double Left Click / Space Click: Sweep for undug tiles on an already revealed tile
